# Translation Crawler

Can be used to crawl a page/user control for resource keys and then copy translations from resource files to a destination page/user control.
The destination resource files (for each language) are created if not exists and all copied translations are saved in a database.
Missing translations are marked with leading star.

The implementation is not generic and may require additional charges for use with another solution.
